I feel that for newbies in stan, or even in Bayesian, the typical features of the posterior draws because of:
1. Insufficient warm-up iterations,
2. Insufficient adapt_delta,
3. Insufficient post warm-up iterations,
4. Whether my certain priors can even be estimated
are mysterious.

I've tried to search on the Internet, and I do not find out any example showing that such as "This kind of posterior draws is because of ...", so I want to collect some of my experience of estimating a Panel Markov Swithcing VAR(PMS-VAR) model, and share some of my thoughts. Since I identify myself as newbie in stan and Bayesian, I'm appriciate your comments.

## Model
### Basic model setting
In short, the basic model settings are:

$$
y_{it} = \text{VAR Coef} + \text{MS Coef} + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

, where VAR coefficients are regime-invariate.

In the full version, the model settings are (detailed descriptions in BILLIO et al. (2016): INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN EUROZONE AND US BOOMS AND BUSTS USING A BAYESIAN PANEL MARKOV-SWITCHING VAR MODEL):

$$
y_{it} = X_{i0t} \gamma_{i0} + \xi_{i1t} X_{i1t} \gamma_{i1} + \cdots + \xi_{iMt} X_{iMt} \gamma_{iM} + \varepsilon_{it}, \; \varepsilon_{it} \sim N_{K} (0, \Sigma_{i}(\xi_{it}))
$$

, where $X_{i0t}$ is the VAR coefficients which contains the lagged variables of $y_{it}$, $\xi_{i1t} X_{i1t} \gamma_{i1} + \cdots + \xi_{iMt} X_{iKt} \gamma_{iM}$ are the MS coefficients for each variable $$k$$ in regime $$m$$, respectively. Finnally, there are $$K$$ variables in the VAR system.

### Transition setting
BILLIO et al. (2016) implements the covariate method from Kaufmann (2011): K-state switching models with time-varying transition distributions – Does credit growth signal stronger effects of variables on inflation?.

Also, it builds a way to "impose the constraint of a minimum duration of 2 months for the recession phase". However, in stan, it does not support discret variable in the parameter and transformed parameter blocks, so I ignore this part, and only the pure original covariate method from Kaufmann (2014) is used.

$$
P(S_{t} = m | S_{t-1} = l, Z_{t}, \gamma) = \xi_{lm, t} = \frac{exp(Z_{t} \gamma^{z}_{lm} + \gamma_{lm})}
{\sum^{M}_{j=1}exp(Z_{t} \gamma^{z}_{lm} + \gamma_{lm})}
$$

, where $Z_t$ is the covariate. For identification purpose, the reference state is the last regime, M, which means that the coefficients $$\gamma^{z}_{lM}$$ and $$\gamma_{lM}$$are zeros.

Besides, since this is a panel model, it can be extended easily.

### Prior setting
BILLIO et al. (2016) tries hierarchical prior, and from the famous 8 school example, more units in the panel model, the more advantage can be gained. 

1) VAR oefficient

$$
\gamma_{i0} \sim N(\lambda_{0}, \underline{\Sigma_{i0}}),
$$

$$
\lambda_{0} \sim N(\underline{\lambda_{0}}, \underline{\Sigma_{0}}),
$$

$$
i = 1, \cdots, N
$$

2) MS oefficient
For each regime $$m$$, it also has hierarchical priors:

$$
\gamma_{im} \sim N(\lambda_{m}, \underline{\Sigma_{im}}),
$$

$$
\lambda_{m} \sim N(\underline{\lambda_{m}}, \underline{\Sigma_{m}}),
$$

$$
i = 1, \cdots, N,  \; m = 1, \cdots, M
$$

3) Covariance

$$
\Sigma^{-1}_{im} \sim W(\underline{\nu_{im}}, \tau_{m})
$$

$$
\tau^{-1}_{m} \sim W(\underline{\nu_{m}}, \underline{\tau_{m}})
$$

I know that ppl suggest to decompose the covariance and use LKJ prior recently, however, LKJ cannot be built hierarchial structure, and if the number of units is large, LKJ prior will suffer from divergents.

From the perspective of coding, in the documentation of stan, it suggests the reparameterization of Wishart\inverse Wishart. I'm not sure if it is OK if I code the global level as inverse Wishart and the individual level as Wishart to avoid inverse $\tau^{-1}_{m}$. I've tried the combinations, such as IW+W, W+W, IW+IW. There was no issue in DGP, however, it is more complicated in the real data.

4) Covariate
   
$$
\gamma^{lm}_{i} = (\gamma^{z}_{i, lm}, \gamma_{i, lm})
$$

$$
\gamma^{lm}_{i} \sim N(\psi, \tau_{i})
$$

$$
\psi \sim N(\underline{psi}, \underline{\tau}), \; i = 1, \cdots, N, \; m = 1, \cdots, M-1
$$

5) Hyper-parameter

VAR coef:

$$
\underline{\lambda_{0}} = 0, \; \underline{\Sigma_{i0}} = I,  \; \underline{\Sigma_{0}} = 10 I
$$

MS coef:

$$
\underline{\lambda_{m}} = 0, \; \underline{\Sigma_{im}} = I,  \; \underline{\Sigma_{m}} = 10 I
$$

Covariance:

$$
\underline{\nu_{im}} = K + 2, \; \underline{\nu_{m}} = K + 2, \; \underline{\tau_m} = 10
$$

Covariate coef:

$$
\underline{\psi} = 0, \; \tau_{i} = I, \underline{\tau} = 10 I
$$

## DGP setting
For the DGP, I set $$N=2$$ units, $$K=2$$ variables, $$M=2$$ regimes, and use a random series as covariate.

Also, I set $$T=50$$, lag length $$P = 1$$.

Each unit has the same transition matrix, $$p11 = 0.7$$, 

My DGP follows what the prior structure says, and with tighter range:

$$
\underline{\lambda_0} = \texttt{[0.5 -0.3 0.2 0.4]}
$$

$$
\underline{\Sigma_{0}} = \texttt{diag(0.1, K*K*P)}
$$

$$
\underline{\Sigma_{i, 0}} = \texttt{replicate(N, diag(0.1, K*K*P), simplify = FALSE)}
$$

$$
\underline{\lambda_{m = 1}} = \texttt{rep(-1, K)}, \; \underline{\lambda_{m = 2}} = \texttt{rep(1, K)}
$$

$$
\underline{\Sigma_{m}} = \texttt{diag(0.1, K)}
$$

$$
\underline{\Sigma_{i, m}} = \texttt{diag(0.1, K)}
$$

$$
\underline{\Sigma_{i, 0}} = \texttt{replicate(N, diag(0.1, K), simplify = FALSE)}
$$

$$
\underline{\nu_{i, m}} = \texttt{rep(50, N)}
$$

$$
\underline{\psi} = \texttt{c(-1, 1)}
$$

$$
\underline{\tau} = \texttt{diag(0.1, 2)}
$$

$$
\underline{\tau{i}} = \texttt{replicate(N, diag(0.1, K), simplify = FALSE)}
$$

The covariate is generated by rnorm with mean = 0 and sd = 0.1.

By doing the above, I think I do not control for the true "need to be estimated" parameters, but through hyper-parameters which gives a little bit more variations to the "true" parameter values.

## Typical shape of posterior draws

In the above model settings, we can see that the VAR coefs are regime-invariate, so if we do not impose restrictions on the ordering of MS coefs, we can only check the diagonose such as Rhat and Ess in $$\gamma_{i0}$$ and $$lp__$$, the rest parameters will suffer from label switching.

### Insufficient warm-up iterations

### Insufficient max_treedepth

#### Less than default(<=10)

### Insufficient adapt_delta

#### adapt_delta and warm-up

### Some questions

### The prior cannot be estimated solid at all?
